## Procedure for proposing and implementing New Standards in Software Development.

TODO once known: write general introduction about standards, where they are kept and where PRs can be submitted 

### Step 1 Use the template
Proposals for new standards are written by at least two individuals. The template for creating standards TODO once known: a reference to the standards template> will be used to document the new standard. Details regarding this template and the submission process are accessible in the documentation of the EE team on standards.

### Involve the guild
The proposal undergoes submission to the guild, initiating discussions on its potential adoption. The EE team then updates the Amsterdam Software Tech Radar to reflect the proposal's status. If accepted, with potential modifications, the submitters are requested to generate a pull request (PR).

### Step 3 Tag reviewers
The submitters will tag in their PR at least two reviewers, one from the EE team and one person whom participated in the discussion during the guild meeting.  When all feedback has been resolved, the EE team proceeds to merge the PR.

### Step 4 Set timer for yearly review 
A one-year timer is initiated to assess the standard's validity later by the EE team. The EE team updates the status in the Amsterdam Software Tech Radar, and the guild maintains a record of the submitter's knowledge on this topic. 

## Procedure for modifying and implementing changes to standards in software development. 
There are two reasons to modify an existing standard: 
1. A request for modification comes from someone in the field.
2. Standards undergo annual reviews within the guild, and modifications stem from this process. The EE team schedules the standards to be reviewed in the guilds. 

In both cases the steps set out in the section 'Procedure for proposing and implementing New Standards in Software Development' are to be followed.
