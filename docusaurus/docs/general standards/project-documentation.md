# Documentation

## licensing
Amsterdam uses the ..... license. Include this in your repo. 

## writing a README
There should be a README for every Amsterdam GitHub repository. A user expects a README to help them:

- understand what the project is
- know which team is responsible (so include your team name in the README)
- evaluate whether the project is useful for them
- learn how to use the project
- understand how to contribute to the project

## architectural decisions 
Every team should record their architectural decisions, known as architectural decision records (ADR). Every Amsterdam GitHub repository should have these records.
