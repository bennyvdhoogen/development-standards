## What is the standard for a README for the city of Amsterdam?

There must be a README.md file for every Github repository of the city of Amsterdam. A README.md file should be an overview and list of instructions to help someone get started with your project.

## When and for whom is this standard?

This standard applies to front-end and back-end developers.<br />
This standard must be applied to all new repositories of the city of Amsterdam (new since May 2024).

## What must be included in the README?

A README must include the following:

- [ ] Name of the project and a short introduction. Give the objectives and motivation behind the project and, if applicable, give the URL of the web application.
- [ ] Name of the team responsible for maintaining the project and how to contact them.
- [ ] An installation guide which contains information about software dependencies.
- [ ] A how-to build and test the application

## What pitfalls to avoid?

- Not keeping the README up-to-date with the latest information about the project.
- Providing vague or ambiguous installation instructions.

## Considerations

- You should ask a member of your team to try the instructions and make sure they work.

## Example

An example can be found in the [development-standards repository](https://github.com/Amsterdam/development-standards/blob/main/README.md).
