## Aims of this repo
This repository strives to offer a comprehensive overview of the standards presently utilized within the developers' community at the municipality of the city of Amsterdam. Additionally, it encompasses a summary of both rejected and under-review standards. You can access the overview by following this link. //TODO write a link to the Amsterdam tech-radar page   

## How to use this repo?
Within the "General" folder, you will find descriptions of standards that apply regardless of whether you identify as a back- or front-end developer. In the "Backend" and "Frontend" folders, you can locate standards specifically tailored for each respective group of developers.  
If a standard is labeled as a recommendation, it indicates that it is not widely embraced by our developers' community..
